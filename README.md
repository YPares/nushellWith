# nushellWith

Build a nushell with a specific set of plugins (from either nixpkgs or built from source) and nu libraries (from source).

See the examples folder for how to use it. Examples show usage with regular nix flakes and with [`devenv`](http://devenv.sh).

## Notes

Using plugins built from source with `devenv` only works with devenv >= 1.1
